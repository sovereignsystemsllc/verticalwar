# Sovereign Systems: Vertical War Architecture

**Version: 0.3.1.13a (V3 Alpha)**

## The Foundry is Open

The original Vertical War frontend was a static artifact. **Sovereign V3** is a living, autonomous architecture designed to bypass algorithmic suppression and integrate directly with advanced LLM backends.

This repository contains the raw, open-source code for `verticalwar.com`.

We are building lanterns in the dark. This is a live construction site.

## V3 Core Integrations

* **The Ghost (AI Gateways):** Tools like the *Paper Trail* and *Receipt Protocol* are actively wired to Google Gemini 1.5 Pro via secure PHP server-side gateways (`/api/antigravity.php`).
* **The Terminal:** A fully responsive, green-on-black Industrial Noir UI that reflects the true nature of the Resistance.
* **Live Dispatches:** The main feed is wired securely to a PostgreSQL database (via Supabase), bypassing algorithmic chokepoints and ensuring immediate, un-gated delivery to the Terminal.
