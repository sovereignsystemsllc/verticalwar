# `/learn` - The Induction Protocol

**Designation:** LEARN // THE RAMP
**Clearance:** Public

This root directory operates as the **Linear Induction Protocol**. It is an entirely distinct wing of the website separated from the `/cmd` execution tools.

Its explicit purpose is to onboard new individuals—those breaking out of the Matrix (the "Rust")—and guide them linearly through the Sovereign philosophy, doctrine, and aesthetic.

## Architecture

* Currently houses the primary **Command Terminal** (`/learn/index.html`), which acts as an immersive, narrative-driven entry point to the system.

**Architectural Rule:** Content in `/learn` must prioritize narrative pacing, immersion, and guided discovery. It is the story, not just a tool.
