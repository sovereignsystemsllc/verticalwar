# `/cmd` - The Sandbox & Toolbelt

**Designation:** COMMAND // THE SANDBOX
**Clearance:** Public (with guarded sub-terminals)

This directory is the **Utility Belt of the Resistance**. It houses references, tools, communication hubs, and "weird stuff" that operators might need once they are already within the ecosystem.

It is *not* for linear onboarding or storytelling. It is for execution.

## Core Nodes

* **/codex:** The Master Salvage database. Dynamic HTML articles pulled from Supabase.
* **/lexicon:** The Sovereign Ledger. A frictionless, two-pane glossary of terms.
* **/dispatch:** The Operator Editor. Secure interface for generating new Codex entries.

**Architectural Rule:** Everything in `/cmd` must adhere to the V3 styling—frictionless, senior-friendly, industrial aesthetic.
