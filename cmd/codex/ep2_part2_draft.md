"That was 1965," you say, looking at Project 226 and the sugar industry buyout of Harvard scientists. "We're smarter now. Disclosures are mandatory."

Are we?

Let's look at the **Funding Effect**. This isn't a conspiracy theory; it is a statistical reality.

> **KEY TERM: FUNDING BIAS (The Sponsorship Effect)**
> The proven statistical tendency of scientific studies to support the interests of their financial sponsors. This is not always explicit corruption; it is often subconscious selection bias.

If you look at independent studies on nutrition, the results are messy (because biology is messy). But if you look at studies funded by the Food Industry? **Five-fold (5x) increase** in favorable results.

In one meta-analysis of nutrition studies funded by major food corporations, **0%** found a result unfavorable to the sponsor. Zero percent. In science, "Zero" is an impossible number. You can't get 0% failure in a complex system unless you are rigging the dice.

The same applies to Pharma. Industry-funded drug trials are **4.05 times** more likely to recommend the drug than independent trials.

**The Lesson:** Funding is not a "potential conflict of interest." Funding is the **primary predictive variable** of the outcome.

If I tell you who paid for the study, I can predict the result with higher accuracy than if I analyze the data myself.

### THE ARMORY: Standard Operating Procedure (SOP)

We are not teaching you this so you can become a cynic. Cynicism is lazy. "Everyone lies" is just as useless as "Everyone tells the truth."

We are teaching you this so you can become an **Auditor**.

You are going to stop reading headlines. You are going to start reading Receipts.

### 🛠️ SOP: THE CONFLICT SCAN

**Objective:** Determine the financial chain of custody for any scientific claim.

**PHASE 1: FILTER (Ignore the Abstract)**
The Abstract is the marketing brochure. It is written to get cited by journalists. It often makes claims the data doesn't support. Skip it initially.

**PHASE 2: INTERNAL AUDIT (The PDF)**
Locate and open the full PDF of the study you are investigating (search the title on PubMed Central or Google Scholar). Execute `Ctrl+F` for:

* "Competing Interests"
* "Conflict of Interest"
* "Disclosure"
* "Funding"
* "Acknowledgements" (Often hides grant numbers).

> **RED FLAG WARNING:** If you see: *"The authors declare no competing interests."* -> Proceed to Phase 3 immediately. Verification is required.

**PHASE 3: EXTERNAL AUDIT (The Ledgers)**

**Target: Academic/Government Scientists**

1. Navigate to `reporter.nih.gov`.
2. Input Name in "Principal Investigator".
3. Review "Total Funding" and "Project Terms".
4. **Verdict:** Is this "independent study" a deliverable for a government grant?

**Target: Medical Doctors (MDs/DOs)**

1. Navigate to `openpaymentsdata.cms.gov`.
2. Input Name.
3. Review "General Payments" (Speaking fees, Consulting fees, Travel).
4. **Verdict:** If Dr. Smith took $150k from Pfizer last year, his TV appearance is a commercial, not a diagnosis.

### FIELD PRACTICUM: Be the Auditor

The Establishment relies on the "**Semmelweis Reflex**"—the reflex-like rejection of new knowledge because it contradicts established norms.

They rely on you being intimidated by the white coat. They rely on you thinking, "Who am I to question a Harvard Professor?"

Who are you? You are the one with the internet and the ability to read a ledger.

**Trust is a religious act. Verification is a scientific act. Stop trusting. Start verifying.**

### 🚀 MISSION: WC-002 // LIVE FIRE EXERCISE

The theory is over. It is time to enter the field.

We have deployed a **Conflict Scanner** to the Sovereign Terminal. This tool allows you to input any news URL and run a Funding Bias analysis.
