# `/synth` - The Synergy Portal

**Designation:** SYNTH // THE GHOST
**Clearance:** Strictly Guarded (`OPERATOR` / `ARCHIVIST` roles only)

This directory is the **esoteric nexus for deep AI integration** and archival secure logs. It contains the most powerful and sensitive tools in the Sovereign arsenal.

It is a "mysterious portal" intentionally scrubbed from the global public navigation grids.

## Core Nodes

* **/makemyown:** The Auditor Forge. The intake pipeline for generating Sovereign Exoskeletons.
* **/rika:** Secure Intelligence Terminal. Direct interface with the FSK-RIKA Forensic Synthesizer.
* **/logs:** The Gas Station Logs. The foundational history and raw archives of the project.

**Architectural Rule:** Access to `/synth/index.html` is open to build intrigue, but every sub-node MUST be locked down tightly using Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) and the `accessGuard.js` protocol to instantly reject unauthenticated traces.
